  - git add boo (adds boo file)
  - git commit boo (commits boo to your current branch)
  - git commit -a boo (adds and commits boo to your current branch at the same time, "git commit -a" should be preferred if 1 file has been changed/added)
  - git branch test (opens a new branch called test)
  - git checkout test (assures you are currently on the test branch)
  - git checkout -b test (a shortcut of both creating a new branch and checking out on the new branch simulataneously)
  - git branch (lists all local branches)
  - git commit boo master (commits boo to the master branch)
  - git merge test (merges test branch to your currenct branch)
  
  - git log --graph --decorate --all (shows the history log of commits and where head is also can be observed)
  - git reset --hard HEAD^ (moves head one step below where it is placed currently. Meaning you can reset to where head was pointing before after any merge is placed)
  - git reset --hard 234212 ( here 234212 is some random commit number where you want to move head to)
  
  - git clone --bare work remote (bare clones repository)
  - git clone work remote (clones repo remote from repo work)
  
  - git remote -v (shows possible operations on remote-universal git project)
  - git branch -r (shows you all remote repo branches)
  - git branch -a (show your and the remote repo branches)
  
  - git push -u origin test (pushes your current branch test to the origin. You need to set-upstream while pushing to origin that's why -u is typed)
  
  - git tag v1.0 b1232 (we can tag commit ids if we have difficulty recalling them)
  - git push origin --tags (also pushes tags to the remote repo)
  
  - git rebase -i HEAD^^ (rebases late 2 commits when you change label as "squash" of the latest commit you make 1 commit instead of 2)
  - Once pushed never rebase! screws things up!
  
  - git reflog (lists latest commits that are recently being worked on)
